Flipper4J is a library for managing feature flags.
It is heavily inspired by the [original Flipper implementation](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper) in Ruby.

## Installation

Releases are published into the Maven Central Repository.
Snapshot releases are available in the GitLab Package Registry for this project.

### Gradle

```kts

    maven(url = "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/38232779/packages/maven")
}
```

</details>

The project is separated into multiple modules. Choose matching adapter for your use-case.

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.gitlab.taucher2003.flipper4j.adapter</groupId>
    <artifactId><!-- Your required adapter --></artifactId>
    <version><!-- Your desired version --></version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

```kts
implementation("com.gitlab.taucher2003.flipper4j.adapter", /* Your required adapter*/"", /* Your desired version*/"")
```

### Available Adapters

| ArtifactId | Use Case                                                               |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| http       | For use with `Flipper::Api`, connects to a remote HTTP Flipper Backend |
| property   | Uses System properties to determine status of feature toggles          |

The adapter pulls in the Flipper4J Core, the dependency does not need to be added manually.

## Configuration

The exact configuration depends on the chosen adapter. The adapters follow this convention:

```javascript
var flipper = new FlipperConfigurator()
        // adapter specific configuration
        .build()
        .createFlipper();
```

## Usage

After creating the `Flipper` instance, it can be used to evaluate feature toggles.

```javascript
if(flipper.isEnabled("cool_new_feature")) {
    // do cool new stuff
} else {
    // do boring old stuff
}
```

### Evaluation with Context

This library can evaluate feature toggles with context.
Classes which represent a context must implement the `FlipperIdentifier` interface.

```java
class User implements FlipperIdentifier {
    private final int id;
    // constructor etc.

    public String flipperId() {
        return "User:" + id;
    }
}
```

Instances of these classes can be passed to the `isEnabled` method.

```javascript
var user = new User();

if(flipper.isEnabled("cool_new_feature", user)) {
    // the user can use the cool new feature
} else {
    // the user can only use the boring old feature
}
```

### Available evaluation Gates

- [Boolean](#boolean)
- [Actors](#actors)
- [Percentage of Actors](#percentage-of-actors)
- [Percentage of Time](#percentage-of-time)

If one of the gates evaluates to `true`, the feature is considered enabled.

#### Boolean

The boolean gate is used to globally enable a feature.
It is used without context and will ignore the context if it is passed to the check.

#### Actors

The actors gate uses a list of actors to determine if the feature is enabled or not.
Eligible actors implement the `FlipperIdentifier` interface and can be passed as context to the `isEnabled(flag, context)` method.

If used without context/actor, the gate evaluates to `false`.

#### Percentage of Actors

This gate evaluates to `true` for the given percent of actors. The evaluation is constant for each actor.
If the gate evaluates to `true` for a given actor, it will always evaluate to `true` for this specific actor.

When no actor is used, the gate will evaluate to `true` if the percentage is set to `100`.

#### Percentage of Time

This gate evaluates to `true` for the given percent of method calls. The evaluation is not constant for
each actor and can lead to poor user experience if a feature is not constantly available or not available.

When no actor is used, the gate still evaluates tha random value and can evaluate to `true`.

### Toggle Modification

Administrative methods to change the state of toggles are exposed within the `FlipperAdmin`.
An instance of the `FlipperAdmin` can be retrieved with the `admin()` method on the `Flipper` instance.

### Adapter specifics

#### properties Adapter

The properties adapter expects feature gate properties in the format `<prefix>.<toggle_name>.<gate_name>`.
The prefix is set in the `FlipperConfigurator` with the `setPropertyPrefix()` method.

`toggle_name` corresponds to the name of the flag you are checking.

`gate_name` can be one of:

- `boolean`
- `actors`
- `percentage_of_actors`
- `percentage_of_time`

The values for the different gates are in different formats:

| Flag                   | Value format                                                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `boolean`              | String `true` if the gate is enabled                                                                         |
| `actors`               | String containing all actors for which the gate is enabled<br/>By default, the actors are separated with `,` |
| `percentage_of_actors` | String representing a valid double value between 0 and 100                                                   |
| `percentage_of_time`   | String representing a valid double value between 0 and 100                                                   |
